abstract="Plankton are fundamental and essential to marine ecosystem, and its survey is significant for sustainable development and ecosystem balance of oceans. The large amount of plankton species and complex relationship among different classes bring difficulty for us to design an automatic plankton classification system. Thus, we develop our model based on convolutional neural network and aim to overcome these shortages. We consider two different ways to extract global and local features to describe shape and texture information of plankton. Furthermore, we design a pyramid fully connected structure to merge different inner products from each sub networks. The experimental results prove our model can take advantage of multiple features and performs better than original convolutional neural network.",

ABSTRACT = {In this study, we propose a method for training convolutional neural networks to make them identify and classify images with higher classification accuracy. By combining the Cartesian and polar coordinate systems when describing the images, the method of recognition and classification for plankton images is discussed. The optimized classification and recognition networks are constructed. They are available for in situ plankton images, exploiting the advantages of both coordinate systems in the network training process. Fusing the two types of vectors and using them as the input for conventional machine learning models for classification, support vector machines (SVMs) are selected as the classifiers to combine these two features of vectors, coming from different image coordinate descriptions. The accuracy of the proposed model was markedly higher than those of the initial classical convolutional neural networks when using the in situ plankton image data, with the increases in classification accuracy and recall rate being 5.3% and 5.1% respectively. In addition, the proposed training method can improve the classification performance considerably when used on the public CIFAR-10 dataset.},

    abstract = "{ZooScan with ZooProcess and Plankton Identifier (PkID) software is an integrated analysis system for acquisition and classification of digital zooplankton images from preserved zooplankton samples. Zooplankton samples are digitized by the ZooScan and processed by ZooProcess and PkID in order to detect, enumerate, measure and classify the digitized objects. Here we present a semi-automatic approach that entails automated classification of images followed by manual validation, which allows rapid and accurate classification of zooplankton and abiotic objects. We demonstrate this approach with a biweekly zooplankton time series from the Bay of Villefranche-sur-mer, France. The classification approach proposed here provides a practical compromise between a fully automatic method with varying degrees of bias and a manual but accurate classification of zooplankton. We also evaluate the appropriate number of images to include in digital learning sets and compare the accuracy of six classification algorithms. We evaluate the accuracy of the ZooScan for automated measurements of body size and present relationships between machine measures of size and C and N content of selected zooplankton taxa. We demonstrate that the ZooScan system can produce useful measures of zooplankton abundance, biomass and size spectra, for a variety of ecological studies.}",
